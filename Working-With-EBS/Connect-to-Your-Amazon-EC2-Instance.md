# Connect to You Amazon EC2 Instance

In order to connect to the EC2, you will need to be able to SSH into the server. MacOS and Linux users can do this via the command line. If on a Windows device, then a program will need to be installed in order to allow for SSH access. The recommended program is Putty.exe and can be found here: https://www.putty.org
